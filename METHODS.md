# Methods

Every methodological decision, with the date it was made. Once the season starts, decisions here stay fixed. Any change is logged as a new dated entry and never edited in place.

## 2026-10-21: Project setup

- **Storage.** Files in `data/` are the source of truth and are committed to this repository as the open dataset. Every run also copies them to a Supabase database (for the future website). If the Supabase write fails, the run carries on, and `python run.py sync` copies the missing data later.
- **Raw API responses** are committed gzip-compressed (`data/raw/gw{N}/{endpoint}_{UTC timestamp}.json.gz`), so anyone can rebuild every snapshot from source.
- **Data access.** Only public, read-only FPL API endpoints. Requests go through one module that caches every response, waits between requests, caps how many times each endpoint can be fetched per gameweek, and never sends cookies or logins.
- **Decision timing.** Each gameweek, all teams decide once, from the same snapshot, about 24 hours before the deadline. There are no mid-week or daily transfers. Transfers use the prices in that snapshot.
- **Token measurement.** In phase 1, snapshot size is estimated as characters ÷ 3.5. Exact token counts are recorded from the real agent calls' usage data from phase 4 onwards.
